## About FOSSEE  
This repository is part of the **FOSSEE (Free/Libre and Open Source Software for Education)** initiative at **IIT Bombay**.  
The FOSSEE project promotes the use of **open-source software in education and research** by developing resources, supporting open-source tools, and encouraging student contributions. It provides alternatives to proprietary tools, making advanced technology more accessible.

## About eSim  
[eSim](https://esim.fossee.in/) is an **open-source EDA tool** developed under the FOSSEE project. It is a combination of **KiCad** for schematic capture and **NgSpice** for simulation, designed to support both digital and analog circuit design.  

### Key Features of eSim  
- Free and open-source alternative to commercial EDA tools.  
- Supports **digital, analog, and mixed-signal circuit simulation**.  
- Enables **device modeling** and custom component creation.  
- Provides waveform analysis for design validation.  
- Works across Linux and Windows platforms.
