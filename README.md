## üèó Internship Work  

### üîπ What is Subcircuit Design?  
Subcircuit design focuses on creating **fundamental digital building blocks** such as adders, multiplexers, flip-flops, and counters. These smaller modules can be combined to form larger digital systems. Using **Verilog HDL**, such circuits are described at the register-transfer level (RTL), simulated for functionality, and verified through testbenches and waveform analysis.  

### üîπ What is Mixed-Signal Circuit Design & Simulation?  
Mixed-signal circuits combine both **digital and analog components** (e.g., ADCs, DACs, and interface circuits). Their design involves **Verilog for digital parts** and **Verilog-AMS/eSim for analog parts**. Simulation ensures that the analog and digital sections interact correctly, enabling validation of real-world system behavior.  

### üîπ What is Device Modeling?  
Device modeling involves creating **mathematical and simulation models** for semiconductor devices such as **diodes and MOSFETs**. These models are used to study device-level behavior (I‚ÄìV curves, transconductance, etc.) and integrate them into larger circuits. Using **eSim and NgSpice**, custom models can be created and tested for accuracy against theoretical characteristics.
